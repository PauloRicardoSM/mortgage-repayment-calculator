- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- GSAP

### What I learned

I further enhanced my understanding of form accessibility and learned how to create easy-to-read, well-structured HTML, which simplifies the application of SCSS. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge of jQuery. Here is a piece of my formulary:
```html
<fieldset id="fmortgageAmount" class="borderHidden">
          <legend class="visually-hidden" id="mortgageAmountLabel">Mortgage Amount</legend>
          <p class="pForm">
            <label for="imortgageAmount">Mortgage Amount</label>
            <div id="amountGrid" class="yellowHover">
              <input type="number" name="mortgageAmount" class="input inputNumber" id="imortgageAmount" aria-labelledby="mortgageAmountLabel" aria-describedby="mortgageAmountError" min="0" required>
              <span id="leftSymbol" class="yellowHover">Â£</span>
            </div>

            <br>

            <span class="error" id="mortgageAmountError" aria-live="polite">This field is required</span>
          </p>
</fieldset>
```
I tried to make it as accessible as possible by linking each error message to the right field and each label to its corresponding input.

### Continued development

For future projects, I intend to work and improve my skills and competencies in:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- SCSS
- Accessibility
- JQuery
- GSAP
  
I also plan to start studying some JavaScript frameworks like React, in addition to starting with the basics of databases and backend with the Python framework Django.

### Useful resources
- Copilot (AI of the EDGE browser) and ChatGPT: As I already have a bagarrem, I used them only to point out possible bugs and errors that I found during the course of the project.
