## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- GSAP

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I’ve gained further insight into using JQuery to enhance the site’s dynamism and streamline the script. However, I must concede that scripting in certain scenarios posed quite a challenge. Below is a code snippet where I verify the presence of any empty fields and validate the provided email address.
```javascript
$(".input").each(function () {
  if (!$(this).val()) {
    $(this).nextAll(".card-form-error").css("display", "block");
  
    hasErros = true;
  } else {
    $(this).nextAll(".card-form-error").css("display", "none");
    
    if ($(this).attr('type') === 'email' && !emailRegex.test($(this).val())) {
      $('#emailInvalidError').css('display', 'block');
      hasErros = true;
    } else if ($(this).attr('type')  === 'email') {
      $('#emailInvalidError').css('display', 'none');
    }  
  }
});
``` 

### Continued development

For future projects, I intend to work and improve my skills and competencies in:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- SCSS
- Accessibility
- JQuery
- GSAP
  
I also plan to start studying some JavaScript frameworks like React, in addition to starting with the basics of databases and backend with the Python framework Django.

### Useful resources
- [Curso HTML5 e CSS3 - Módulo 4 de 5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dkcVCk2Bn_fdVQ81Fkrh6WT) - This playlist from the [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemV%C3%ADdeo) channel helped me a lot to refresh the fundamentals of creating a good form.
- Copilot (AI of the EDGE browser) - is a powerful tool that has helped me correct errors and also giving ideas for problem solving. It is important to note that we should not copy codes generated by AI, but rather learn from them various ways of how to solve a problem and adapt it to our own way of coding.
